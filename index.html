							<h3>Shinoj Kumaran | <b>Head of Test and Product Manager</b> | Cloudpay</h3>
							<i>"We had an urgent need for performance tuning and technical re-design for one of our
								major product initiative. Luciano was happy to step-in and offer his help as technical
								architect. He learned the complex system very quickly, did a technical investigation and
								solved the performance tuning issues. His way of looking at a problem from different
								angles and ability to come up with great technical design that precisely satisfy
								functional complexities are impressive. What I appreciate the most is, he not only
								approach it from pure technical point of view; but he work closely with PO to understand
								the product functional needs before solutioning. His sense of responsibility and
								commitment towards driving the technical re-design roadmap with developers and guiding
								them thru-out the process until our product launch was remarkable."</i>
